# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

This application allows a user to play a tic-tac-toe game after they have created an account and signed in with that account. The user can begin a new game of tic-tac-toe alternating between X and O until either a win or draw. After a game has been completed, the user can play again or choose to sign out of the application.
